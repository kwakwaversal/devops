# devops
Collection of Dockerfiles and Vagrantfiles to test software and scratch itches

# Description
When you want to learn something new in the IT world, there's a few different
approaches you might take.

* Read lots and lots of documentation - you might understand it as you read it,
  but will ultimately lose some of the knowledge you gained to sleep, context
  switching etc. if you don't apply any of it within a certain timeframe.
* Install some software and try and get it to do what you want, occasionally
  referring to the documentation. You might get it working, but cannot remember
  the steps you took to get there.
* Read lots of documentation, install and configure as you go along, and do it
  in such a way that it's reproducable (and maybe even testable) using a
  specific toolchain.

I often opt for the 3rd option. This repository uses a collection of tools to
scratch those itches, sprinkled with tests to make sure software DWIM/A (does
what I mean/assume).

# What
This repository contains the following software.

* rsyslog - multi-line custom logs, shipped to graylog
